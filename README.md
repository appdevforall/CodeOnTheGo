## Installation

 <a href="https://www.appdevforall.org/codeonthego">Download the Code On The Go APK from the App Dev for All website.</a>

## Limitations

- For working with projects in Code On The Go, your project must use Android Gradle Plugin v7.2.0 or
  newer. Projects with older AGP must be migrated to newer versions.
- SDK Manager is already included in Android SDK and is accessible in Code On The Go via its Terminal.
  But, you cannot use it to install some tools (like NDK) because those tools are not built for
  Android.
- No official NDK support because we haven't built the NDK for Android.

The app is still being developed actively. It's in beta stage and may not be stable. if you have any
issues using the app, please let us know.
