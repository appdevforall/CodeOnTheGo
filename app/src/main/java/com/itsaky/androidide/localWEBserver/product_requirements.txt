## Product Requirements Document: Simple Local Web Server

### 1. Introduction
This document outlines the requirements for a simple web server designed to operate on a local machine. The server will provide basic HTTP/1.1 functionality, serving content from both a local directory and a SQLite3 database. It is intended for development and testing purposes where advanced features like encryption or cookies are not required.

### 2. Goals
* Provide a reliable and configurable web server for local development.
* Support serving static files from a specified directory.
* Enable dynamic content retrieval from a SQLite3 database.
* Implement core HTTP/1.1 features including KeepAlive.
* Handle common HTTP error conditions gracefully.

### 3. Out of Scope
* HTTPS/SSL/TLS encryption
* Cookies
* Advanced routing or URL rewriting
* Server-side scripting languages (e.g., PHP, Python, Ruby execution)
* WebSockets
* Load balancing or high availability features
* Authentication or authorization

### 4. User Stories
* As a developer, I want to configure the server's listening port so that I can avoid port conflicts with other applications.
* As a developer, I want the server to serve static files from a specified directory so that I can easily host my front-end assets.
* As a developer, I want the server to retrieve content from a SQLite3 database so that I can serve dynamic content without complex setups.
* As a developer, I want the server to support KeepAlive connections so that I can improve performance for multiple requests from the same client.
* As a developer, I want the server to return appropriate error pages (e.g., 404, 500) so that I can debug issues effectively.

### 5. Functional Requirements

#### 5.1 Server Configuration
* **FR.001: IP Address Binding**
    * The server MUST bind exclusively to the **'localhost'** IP address (127.0.0.1 or ::1 for IPv6).
* **FR.002: Configurable Port**
    * The server MUST allow configuration of the listening port via a command-line argument or configuration file.
    * Default port should be `8080` if not specified.
* **FR.003: Document Root Directory Configuration**
    * The server MUST allow configuration of a **document root directory** for serving static files.
    * This directory should be configurable via a command-line argument or configuration file.
* **FR.004: SQLite3 Database Path Configuration**
    * The server MUST allow configuration of the **path to the SQLite3 database file** via a command-line argument or configuration file.

#### 5.2 Content Serving

* **FR.005: Static File Serving**
    * The server MUST serve files from the configured document root directory.
    * Requests for paths corresponding to files within this directory MUST return the file's content with the correct MIME type.
* **FR.006: SQLite3 Database Content Serving**
    * The server MUST be able to retrieve and serve content stored within the configured SQLite3 database.
    * The specific mechanism for mapping URLs to database content (e.g., a specific table, a predefined query based on the URL path) will be defined during design, but the capability must exist.
    * Content retrieved from the database MUST be served with the appropriate `Content-Type` header.
* **FR.007: Content Prioritization**
    * If a requested path exists both as a static file and as a record in the database, the server's behavior (which content to serve) needs to be defined. For now, **static files will take precedence over database content**.

#### 5.3 HTTP Protocol Support

* **FR.008: HTTP/1.1 Compliance**
    * The server MUST adhere to the **HTTP/1.1 specification**.
* **FR.009: KeepAlive Support**
    * The server MUST support **HTTP KeepAlive connections**, allowing multiple requests over a single TCP connection.
    * The server MUST correctly handle the `Connection: keep-alive` header in requests and responses.
* **FR.010: Methods Supported**
    * The server MUST support the **GET** and **HEAD** HTTP methods.
    * Support for other methods (POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) is out of scope.
* **FR.011: No Cookies**
    * The server MUST NOT send or process any **HTTP cookies**.

#### 5.4 Error Handling

* **FR.012: 404 Not Found**
    * The server MUST return a **404 Not Found** status code and an appropriate error page when a requested resource (file or database entry) does not exist.
* **FR.013: 500 Internal Server Error**
    * The server MUST return a **500 Internal Server Error** status code and an appropriate error page for unhandled server-side exceptions or critical failures (e.g., database connection issues).
* **FR.014: 501 Not Implemented**
    * The server MUST return a **501 Not Implemented** status code and an appropriate error page for HTTP methods that are not supported (e.g., POST, PUT, DELETE).
* **FR.015: 503 Service Unavailable**
    * The server MUST return a **503 Service Unavailable** status code and an appropriate error page if the server is temporarily unable to handle the request (e.g., due to resource exhaustion, though this is less likely for a simple local server).

### 6. Non-Functional Requirements

* **NFR.001: Performance**
    * The server should be able to handle a reasonable number of concurrent connections for a local development environment (e.g., 10-20 concurrent connections without significant degradation).
* **NFR.002: Reliability**
    * The server should run stably without crashing under normal operating conditions.
* **NFR.003: Maintainability**
    * The codebase should be well-structured, commented, and easy to understand for future enhancements or bug fixes.
* **NFR.004: Configurability**
    * All configurable parameters (port, document root, database path) should be easily set via command-line arguments or a simple configuration file format (e.g., JSON, INI).

---

### 7. Technical Architecture (High-Level)
* **Language:** TBD (e.g., Python, Node.js, Go)
* **Core Components:**
    * **HTTP Server Module:** Responsible for handling TCP connections, parsing HTTP requests, and formatting HTTP responses.
    * **File System Handler:** For serving static files from the configured document root.
    * **SQLite3 Database Interface:** For querying and retrieving content from the SQLite3 database.
    * **Configuration Loader:** For parsing command-line arguments or configuration files.
* **Deployment:** Standalone executable or script.

---

### 8. Future Considerations (Out of Scope for Initial Release)
* Basic logging of requests and errors.
* More sophisticated URL routing.
* Support for additional HTTP methods.
* Simple templating for database content.

---

### 9. Open Questions
* How will the mapping from URL paths to content within the SQLite3 database be defined? (e.g., a specific table name, a convention for key-value pairs).
* What is the expected maximum size of files to be served from the document root and database?

This PRD provides a solid foundation for developing your web server. What specific details about the SQLite3 content serving or configuration do you want to define next?
