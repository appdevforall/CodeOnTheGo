# TODO: Can we delete the remaining *.deb files after the dpkg command runs? --DS, 29-Oct-2024
# We can delete files from caches folder inside the app, but not from assets folder.
# Assets folder is a backup folder for the case when we will need to restore IDE functionality.
# Also we should keep files for all architectures is assets, so when app is shared to a different phone, it will still be operational.

# Technically we can comment out line 45 and run rm -rf "${cache_dir}/${abi}/" for all the cached deb folders.
# But during the development process I would like to keep it. To avoid reinstalling app every time idesetup had any issues
# during execution.

# When we will use current idesetup for some time and will be sure it works we should comment out lines 45/47 and let it
# delete all deb files files.
# Or use a pkg clean command, it should also do the thing.
